# Thomas McCabe's First CS193 Homework

### Thomas's favorite things about CS193:
- _It is run by students instead of old professors_
- **The lecture hall has windows**
- `Optional attendance on fridays`
- _Chill vibes during class_

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
